				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Let’s be honest, operating a business is expensive and decisions about where to spend limited advertising dollars require much thought and consideration. Newspaper, radio and television advertising can yield mixed results even IF you have a size-able budget to run ads during peak times or inside publications with wide, diverse audiences. Daily deal services could ‘potentially’ generate an influx of revenue in an instant. However, once the dust settles, will the operating expenses sacrificed to run the deal dwarf the revenue it generated? Additionally, will deal seekers want to ever come back to your business and pay full price for the same service? With Plenty4/7 these concerns are non-existent. That is why we are confident that our approach is the safe, sound and effective advertising choice for merchant businesses of all sizes and types.</p>
