# Plenty 4/7


Plenty4/7 was conceived from the premise that hard-working local businesses, the communities in which they serve and impactful charitable organizations could all win and thrive, together, within one business platform. As this concept expanded, we became increasingly determined to perfect a winning formula focused on four central pillars; Community, Commerce, Charity, Connected.

The signature product that wholly embodies our service and brand is the Plenty4/7 VIP Membership program. This program engages commerce by allowing merchants of all services and types to advertise exclusive deals to our VIP Member network for 100% free. The program engages the community by partnering with groups such as youth sports teams, religious organizations, trade shows, daycare centers, school bands/clubs and more to sell memberships as online and offline fundraising campaigns with potential to net very high profit margins. And finally, our program strategically engages partnerships with worthwhile, influential charitable organizations by funding them 10% of proceeds for every VIP membership sold directly via our website.

And fortunately, the biggest beneficiaries to our program are our VIP Members. Why? Because the exclusive deals are simply awesome! Whether taking advantage of sweet daily incentive deals like 15% off new customer discounts, free meal upgrades, buy one get one free offers or steeper discounted flash deal offers, a Plenty4/7 VIP Membership connects members to a wide assortment of VIP experiences. When you are a VIP member, the deals are automatically yours from any region or market within our network; no purchasing or remembering to print vouchers is necessary. Simply show up at a merchant’s place of business and pull up their Plenty4/7 deal profile page via your mobile device or tablet. From there, login to your VIP Membership account to reveal the “Redeem Now” code while displaying your Plenty4/7 VIP Member card at checkout. It's that simple. For our VIP Members, our mission is to provide plenty of dynamic, never static, VIP experiences at all times...in other words, Plenty4/7.

We are 100% committed to creating winning deals and rewarding experiences for our partnering merchants, community fundraisers, charitable partners and VIP members alike. That's our deal and we're sticking to it!
